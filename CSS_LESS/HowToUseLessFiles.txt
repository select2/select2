Using the Select2 LESS Files

Reminder - The goal of LESS files is dynamically generate the CSS files through the use of variables and something 
LESS calls mixins.  The advantage of LESS, is you can have much more consistency between parts of your CSS file
because the values are all hooked to the same LESS variables.  Things like colors, padding and margins can all be 
consistent and only have to be changed in one location.  The other major advantage, if a user needs to adjust 
any of the values to match their theme or styles, it can be easily done by setting the variable to a different 
value.


How to use LESS to generate standard Select2.css

1) LESS compile the select2.less file - There are many standard tools to do this and tools like Visual Studio will
	automatically do this when adding a less file
2) Compiled LESS file generates a select2.css
3) Look inside the select2.less and you see all it is an import of the variables and the separate LESS files


How to use LESS to generate a Select2.css that integrates with Bootstrap

1) LESS compile the select2-bootstrap.less file - This file is very much like the select2.less, but includes
	the bootstrap related variables, bootstrap select2 variable overrides and some additional mark up to take
	advantage of the bootstrap framework.
	

How to add your own styling to select2.less or select2-bootstrap.less

1) Duplicate the LESS file you wish to override (select2.less or select2-bootstrap.less) and name it "file".less
2) Edit new file and add your own variable less file or directly add variables to the file after the other
	"variables".less files, but before select2container.less
3) LESS compile "file".less into a "file".css to be used by your site
